# Blind
A QAD repo to randomize your a Python source file. Why would you want to do this?

My opinion is that natural language != machine language and typically it's more important to trace code by thinking about what's "in memory" vs what's "in syntax". So I made a script to try out the idea for Python files. I haven't used this much, ideally, I think, in the future I'd like to do this with .c / .cpp files but pull in all relevant data structures into the view of the source itself so you don't have to go splunking endlessly around header files to figure out what's going on and you can always just bottom out at primitive data types or class definitions. The only problem with that is that it's not easy bc of indirection and auto-generated code. Hrmmmm.... maybe I'll do something like that next.
